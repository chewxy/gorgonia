# travis compiles commands in script and then executes in bash.  By adding
# set -e we are changing the travis build script's behavior, and the set
# -e lives on past the commands we are providing it.  Some of the travis
# commands are supposed to exit with non zero status, but then continue
# executing.  set -x makes the travis log files extremely verbose and
# difficult to understand.
